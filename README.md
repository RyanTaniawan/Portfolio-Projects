# DATA EXPLORATION BY USING SQL

In this part I am doing data exploration to gain insights from COVID-19 and book sales dataset. Tools used in the data exploration is Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
The gained insight is visualized by Tableau here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.taniawan
